# HTML5 History Test

An interactive test for the HTML5 history API, with focus on the addressbar updating properly - something too many implementions still get wrong.

Test results are gathered via [Browserscope](http://browserscope.org/).

For an overview of affected platforms or devices, check out [the ticket in Scott Jehl's device bugs project](https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues/29).
